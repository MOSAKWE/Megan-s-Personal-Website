<p> Hey y'all! My Megan Osakwe and I am currently 17 years old and a rising senior. Two things I am very passionate about are computer science and mental health. I plan to major in computer science in college and hope to get a job in the technology industry in the future. I am currently working to get my Associate of Arts degree prior to graduating high school. My interests include reading, swimming, coding, and learning about mental health.</p>
